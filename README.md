# ultos

A custom bootc operating system image built on Universal Blue's finpilot template. ultos is based on [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) and [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io), using the **multi-stage build architecture** to combine resources from multiple OCI containers for modularity and maintainability.

This OS is assembled in the same way that Bluefin, Aurora, and Bluefin LTS are built, leveraging shared components from @projectbluefin/common while providing full customization capabilities.

## For Developers: Forking and Customizing

If you want to create your own custom OS based on ultos:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click "Fork" on GitHub to create your own copy.

### 2. Customize Your Image

Choose your base image in `Containerfile` (line 48):
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main:latest
```

Add your packages in `build/10-build.sh`:
```bash
dnf5 install -y package-name
```

Customize your apps:
- Add Brewfiles in `custom/brew/` ([guide](custom/brew/README.md))
- Add Flatpaks in `custom/flatpaks/` ([guide](custom/flatpaks/README.md))
- Add ujust commands in `custom/ujust/` ([guide](custom/ujust/README.md))

### 3. Development Workflow

All changes should be made via pull requests:

1. Open a pull request on GitHub with the change you want.
2. The PR will automatically trigger:
   - Build validation
   - Brewfile, Flatpak, Justfile, and shellcheck validation
   - Test image build
3. Once checks pass, merge the PR
4. Merging triggers publishes a `:stable` image

### 4. Deploy Your Custom Image

Switch to your image:
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/your-username/your-repo-name:stable
sudo systemctl reboot
```

## GitHub Actions Setup

The repository includes automated workflows that need to be enabled:

### Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository on GitHub
2. Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
3. Your first build will start automatically!

### Configure Repository Permissions

For the workflows to run properly, you need to ensure GitHub Actions has the right permissions:

1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to **Actions → General**
3. Scroll down to "Workflow permissions"
4. Select **"Read and write permissions"**
5. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** (needed for Renovate)
6. Click "Save"

Without these permissions, the build workflow cannot push images to GitHub Container Registry.

### Workflows Included

- **build.yml** - Builds container images on every push to main
- **clean.yml** - Cleans up old images (90+ days old)
- **renovate.yml** - Automatically updates dependencies
- **validate-*.yml** - Validates code quality on pull requests

Note: Image signing is disabled by default. Your images will build successfully without any signing keys. Once you're ready for production, see "Optional: Enable Image Signing" below.

## Optional: Enable Image Signing

Image signing is disabled by default to let you start building immediately. However, signing is strongly recommended for production use.

### Why Sign Images?

- Verify image authenticity and integrity
- Prevent tampering and supply chain attacks
- Required for some enterprise/security-focused deployments
- Industry best practice for production images

### Setup Instructions

1. Generate signing keys:
```bash
cosign generate-key-pair
```

This creates two files:
- `cosign.key` (private key) - Keep this secret
- `cosign.pub` (public key) - Commit this to your repository

2. Add the private key to GitHub Secrets:
   - Copy the entire contents of `cosign.key`
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions ([GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository))
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `SIGNING_SECRET`
   - Value: Paste the entire contents of `cosign.key`
   - Click "Add secret"

3. Replace the contents of `cosign.pub` with your public key:
   - Open `cosign.pub` in your repository
   - Replace the placeholder with your actual public key
   - Commit and push the change

4. Enable signing in the workflow:
   - Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml`
   - Find the "OPTIONAL: Image Signing with Cosign" section.
   - Uncomment the steps to install Cosign and sign the image (remove the `#` from the beginning of each line in that section).
   - Commit and push the change

5. Your next build will produce signed images!

Important: Never commit `cosign.key` to the repository. It's already in `.gitignore`.

## Love Your Image? Let's Go to Production

Ready to take your custom OS to production? Enable these features for enhanced security, reliability, and performance:

### Production Checklist

- [ ] **Enable Image Signing** (Recommended)
  - Provides cryptographic verification of your images
  - Prevents tampering and ensures authenticity
  - See "Optional: Enable Image Signing" section above for setup instructions
  - Status: **Disabled by default** to allow immediate testing

- [ ] **Enable SBOM Attestation** (Recommended)
  - Generates Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security
  - Provides transparency about what's in your image
  - Requires image signing to be enabled first
  - To enable:
    1. First complete image signing setup above
    2. Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml`
    3. Find the "OPTIONAL: SBOM Attestation" section around line 232
    4. Uncomment the "Add SBOM Attestation" step
    5. Commit and push
  - Status: **Disabled by default** (requires signing first)

- [ ] **Enable Image Rechunking** (Recommended)
  - Optimizes bootc image layers for better update performance
  - Reduces update sizes by 5-10x
  - Improves download resumability with evenly sized layers
  - To enable:
    1. Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml`
    2. Find the "Build Image" step
    3. Add a rechunk step after the build (see example below)
  - Status: **Not enabled by default** (optional optimization)

#### Adding Image Rechunking

After building your bootc image, add a rechunk step before pushing to the registry. Here's an example based on the workflow used by [zirconium-dev/zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium):

```yaml
- name: Build image
  id: build
  run: sudo podman build -t "${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" -f ./Containerfile .

- name: Rechunk Image
  run: |
    sudo podman run --rm --privileged \
      -v /var/lib/containers:/var/lib/containers \
      --entrypoint /usr/libexec/bootc-base-imagectl \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      rechunk --max-layers 96 \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}"

- name: Push to Registry
  run: sudo podman push "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" "${IMAGE_REGISTRY}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}"
```

Alternative approach using a temporary tag for clarity:

```yaml
- name: Rechunk Image
  run: |
    sudo podman run --rm --privileged \
      -v /var/lib/containers:/var/lib/containers \
      --entrypoint /usr/libexec/bootc-base-imagectl \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      rechunk --max-layers 67 \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}-rechunked"
    
    # Tag the rechunked image with the original tag
    sudo podman tag "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}-rechunked" "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}"
    sudo podman rmi "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}-rechunked"
```

**Parameters:**
- `--max-layers`: Maximum number of layers for the rechunked image (typically 67 for optimal balance)
- The first image reference is the source (input)
- The second image reference is the destination (output)
  - When using the same reference for both, the image is rechunked in-place
  - You can also use different tags (e.g., `-rechunked` suffix) and then retag if preferred

- [bootc documentation](https://containers.github.io/bootc/)

### After Enabling Production Features

Your workflow will:
- Sign all images with your key
- Generate and attach SBOMs
- Provide full supply chain transparency

Users can verify your images with:
```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/your-username/your-repo-name:stable
```

## Architecture

This template follows the **multi-stage build architecture** from @projectbluefin/distroless, as documented in the [Bluefin Contributing Guide](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/contributing/).

### Multi-Stage Build Pattern

**Stage 1: Context (ctx)** - Combines resources from multiple sources:
- Local build scripts (`/build`)
- Local custom files (`/custom`)
- **@projectbluefin/common** - Desktop configuration shared with Aurora
- **@projectbluefin/branding** - Branding assets
- **@ublue-os/artwork** - Artwork shared with Aurora and Bazzite
- **@ublue-os/brew** - Homebrew integration

**Stage 2: Base Image** - Default options:
- `ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main:latest` (Fedora-based, default)
- `quay.io/centos-bootc/centos-bootc:stream10` (CentOS-based alternative)

### Benefits of This Architecture

- **Modularity**: Compose your image from reusable OCI containers
- **Maintainability**: Update shared components independently
- **Reproducibility**: Renovate automatically updates OCI tags to SHA digests
- **Consistency**: Share components across Bluefin, Aurora, and custom images

### OCI Container Resources

The template imports files from these OCI containers at build time:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/base-main:latest /system_files /oci/base
COPY --from=ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest /system_files /oci/common
COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/brew:latest /system_files /oci/brew
```

Your build scripts can access these files at:
- `/ctx/oci/base/` - Base system configuration
- `/ctx/oci/common/` - Shared desktop configuration
- `/ctx/oci/branding/` - Branding assets
- `/ctx/oci/artwork/` - Artwork files
- `/ctx/oci/brew/` - Homebrew integration files

**Note**: Renovate automatically updates `:latest` tags to SHA digests for reproducible builds.

## Local Testing

Test your changes before pushing:

```bash
just build              # Build container image
just build-qcow2        # Build VM disk image
just run-vm-qcow2       # Test in browser-based VM
```

## Security

This template provides security features for production use:
- Optional SBOM generation (Software Bill of Materials) for supply chain transparency
- Optional image signing with cosign for cryptographic verification
- Automated security updates via Renovate
- Build provenance tracking

These security features are disabled by default to allow immediate testing. When you're ready for production, see the "Love Your Image? Let's Go to Production" section above to enable them.
